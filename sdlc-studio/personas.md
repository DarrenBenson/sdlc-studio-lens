## SDLC Developer (Darren) {#darren}

**Role:** Developer managing multiple projects with sdlc-studio
**Category:** Primary user

### Goals
- Quickly check project progress without reading individual files
- Find specific stories or epics across projects
- View rendered documents in a clean interface
- Understand which areas of a project are complete vs outstanding

### Pain Points
- Navigating filesystem to find specific SDLC documents is tedious
- No consolidated progress view across epics and stories
- Manual counting of document statuses is error-prone
- Sharing project status requires copying markdown snippets

### Behaviours
- Checks project status at the start of work sessions
- Searches for specific stories when planning next tasks
- Reviews document status after running sdlc-studio commands
- Prefers dark-themed developer tools
- Runs development infrastructure on LAN with Docker
- Comfortable with CLI tools but wants visual oversight

### Technical Context
- Uses sdlc-studio CLI to generate SDLC artefacts
- Manages 1-10 projects simultaneously
- Self-hosts tools on LAN infrastructure
- Docker-based deployment preferred
